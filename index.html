		<h1>What I Do</h1>
		<p>I'm an award-winning editor - based in Bath, England - with a strong passion for the web and digital technologies. I help businesses across the world create content that connects with their customers. As the former editor of <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine">net magazine</a>, my areas of expertise range from user experience and accessibility to ecommerce and performance. Here are some of the services I offer:</p>
		<h2>Consulting</h2>
		<p> With over 12 years of experience in content creation, strategy and management under my hat, in particular for the web and startup industry, I can help boost your content and ensure it connects with your costumers. I provide consultancy for individuals and businesses of all sizes across the world.</p>
		<h2>Workshops</h2>
		<p>I create and host workshops and training sessions on content strategy and marketing, content creation and management, social media, writing for print and online publications, and more. These follow my own custom curriculum or can be tailored to your needs. I'm available for workshops at public events, or you can book me for a bespoke session with your in-house team. Whatever your budget or location, get in touch and we'll work something out.</p>
		<h2>Professional Editing &amp; Copywriting</h2>
		<p>I edited net magazine, the number one publication for web designers and developers, for more than four years and am an expert in the whole production process from commissioning articles to the publication of print and digital products. As I am very knowledgable about web and user experience design, content strategy and marketing, ecommerce, accessibility and many other technical topics, I also offer peer reviews and technical proofreading for a variety of publishers.</p>
		<h2>German Language Services</h2>
		<p>A German native speaker who has lived in the UK for more than 15 years, I'm fluent in both languages and provide German translations and editorial services. For example, I served as consulting production editor on the German edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Lemmy-Ultimate-Tribute-Robin-Alway/dp/3739130261">Lemmy - The Ultimate Tribute</a>,  and as commissioning editor for the (now defunct) German edition of photography blog Photoventure.</p>
		<h2>Content Marketing</h2>
		<p>As editor and conference curator I have gained years of experience in using content-based marketing to grow an audience. I have created and hosted content marketing workshops at various events including <a href="http://www.generateconf.com/">Generate</a> and <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com">beyond tellerrand</a> and can help you create niche content that converts, whether that's creating articles that grab the attention of your customers or making the biggest impact on social media and employing the networks that are right for you.</p>
		<h2>Event Curation</h2>
		<p>I co-founded and continue to curate <a href="http://www.generateconf.com/">Generate</a>,  the conference for web designers and developers, presented by net magazine and <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com">Creative Bloq</a>. This includes nine events in London, New York, San Francisco and Sydney, and my expertise reaches from the speaker selection and outreach, programming and scheduling to marketing and partnerships/sponsorships with a strong focus on accessibility, inclusivity, and diversity.</p>
