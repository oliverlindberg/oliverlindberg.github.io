        <h1>Error 404: Page Not Found</h1>
        <p>Ouch! We Appear to Have a Problem. In the trade we call this error page a 404 &mdash; it's a page not found error message. It could be me, a bad link, a dodgy piece of code or there's an off chance it's you &mdash; did you enter the URL right in the address bar? Either way let's not waste this opportunity.</p>

        <p>You have a few options, you could head back to the <a href="/">home page</a>, read an article from my <a href="https://medium.com/@keirwhitaker/">blog</a> or even check out some of my recent <a href="/#work">work and projects</a>.</p>
        <p>Alternatively if you are feeling a little bit daring you could spend two minutes and watch the instructional, and dare I say educational, video above featuring one of my cultural heroes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain">Mr. Anthony Bourdain</a> make my favourite cocktail &mdash; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroni">Negroni</a>. Enjoy!</p>
